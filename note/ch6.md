## Ambuguity

> A grammar can have more than one parse tree generating a given string of terminals
> Such a grammar is said to be ambiguous

- To solve the issue of ambuguity 
1. **Precedence** determines which operator is evaluated, like * / is evaluated first then + -
2. **Associativity**  which operator is evaluated first in a series of the same operator
    - ex: 5 + 2 - 3 , + and - had same precedence , and + - are left associativity  
    so it become ((5+2)-3)
